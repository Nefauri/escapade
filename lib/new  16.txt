J/Asian indie or western indie?

VM & MM have been pretty dedicated to that solid, single/dual color Anne of green gables type of design which not a lot of other brands do. I'll try to recommend things with nice fitted, long bodices.
>Physical Drop: has made some nice cuts and simple classic dresses. 
>Lief: a bit more modern and bolder with colors/prints but very nice classic stuff. 
>Excentrique: a bit more late than early Victorian inspired but nice silho
>Millefleurs: absolutely dynamite floral OPs with cap sleeves in almost identical cuts to MM. Their chiffon stuff is like an AtelierPierrot and VM lovechild
>taobao brands you could get lucky with: Miss Point, Dear Celine (top tier Taoboa imo), older HMHM
on the western side:
>lily of the valley on etsy makes very good looking jsks for classic. the prints are bolder than VM/MMs muted modus operandi but the silhos are on point.
can't think of any other western indie that makes rococo style things

hope this helps!
